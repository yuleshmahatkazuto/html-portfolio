<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, this is me Yulesh Mahat trying to learn HTML, JavaScript and CSS to land a job in coding industry.
  At this point, I do not have any option and I must make it happen. So, I am studying in my free time.
</p>

<p>These days I have been motivated by a certain someone named David Goggins. At first, I thought he was
  just a random guy who happened to say something about benefits of exercising but I found out that he was
  an ex-Navy SEAL. 
</p>

<p>I have bought a book from Dymocks written by Davind Goggins. And its awesome. The book elaborates on how 
  David Goggins became the person he now is.
